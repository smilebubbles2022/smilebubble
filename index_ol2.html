            <p class="chakra-text css-szw3gd">What happens to the scum of the earth after they die?
              We’re talking about all those criminals, creeps, extortionists and rampant sinners who unintentionally
              bought themselves a one-way ticket down when they committed their horrendous crimes against humanity. </p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-szw3gd">Those are the souls who are transported straight to a parallel universe of
              brimstone and fire, where their flesh is seared off and all that remains is a living skeleton. Their past
              crimes prevent the skeletons from moving on to the afterlife, leaving them trapped for the remainder of
              their endless existence in a world that’s come to be known as the Skeleverse.</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-szw3gd">The Skeleverse cities are now being taken over and run by the Skelectables
              organisation. A splintering mafia type group consisting of 8,888 Killers, extortionists, and thieves of
              all ranks.</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-szw3gd">800 Bosses control the organisation that has a hierarchy of 1,244 Capo
              Skelectables who all run the other 6,848 High Earner &amp; Runner Skelectables. The organisation pool
              their spoils into the Treasure Chest and your objective is to stake your claim to the Treasure Chest chest
              by holding a Trio of the Skelectable hierarchy.</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-szw3gd">What will you do? Will you trade your way to a trio and stake your claim
              or will you sell out at a high price? Get your Skelectable NFT and join the organisation to find out.</p>

            <p class="chakra-text css-uwy0s7">The Skelectables are doing alright for themselves it must be said!</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-uwy0s7">They have really started to thrive in the Skeleverse, in their past lives
              they were mainly armed robbers, con artists and jewellry theives! They have taken all their knowledge from
              their criminal Earth life and have successfully adapted the learnings to take advantage of their new
              environment.</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-uwy0s7">Their features have morphed and changed over time due to the harsh
              environment of where they now co-exist with complete scum from the Earth. Somehow some can even still grow
              hair and facial hair, there are some with tattoos and different eye wear while others who were jewel
              thieves on Earth have gold teeth and piercings. They have access to weapons that include axes, pitchforks
              and even guns amongst other stuff!</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-uwy0s7">Most Skelectables are immune to the B206 virus that is rife in the
              Skeleverse - this virus attacks every bone in their body and makes the Skeletons even more crazy. Some
              Skelectables will protect themselves with face coverings while others just don’t care and want to be
              infected so they are even more crazy!</p>
            <p class="chakra-text css-1mk0izh">The Skelectables have retained a lot of their fashion sense from their
              previous Earth life and some look very bad-ass. Some love to smoke anything they can get their hands on
              and some love to show off their wealth with their teeth.. See for yourself here..</p>
